A collaborative travel planning dataset featuring extended, narrative-rich dialogues between travelers and a knowledgeable assistant, focused on co-constructing detailed, day-by-day itineraries—including destination selection, activity evaluation (with attention to ambiance, lore, accessibility, ratings, price, entrance fees, and seasonal timing), accommodation assessment (with comparative analysis of comfort, amenities, location, value, and guest sentiment), and multi-meal dining planning—all grounded in a richly imagined world where locations are imbued with mythological resonance, cultural traditions, sensory storytelling, and practical decision-making grounded in real-world constraints like budget, scheduling, and personal preferences for pace, atmosphere, and authenticity.
