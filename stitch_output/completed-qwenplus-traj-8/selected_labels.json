But the target candidates provided contain almost no explicit *pro-side evidence* \u2014 instead, they are mostly *con-side claims*, *framing*, or *contentions*, plus a few named sources (e.g., \"Palo Alto Networks (2024) report\u2019s demonstration...\") and general assertions.\n\nCrucially, the only candidates that reflect *pro-side arguments used to counter or attack the con side* are those that represent *con-side positions which the pro side explicitly targets and refutes*.

These are the \u201ctargets of attack\u201d, and per task instructions, we select labels that *implicitly or explicitly tell relevant information to the question*. Since the question is about *evidence used by the pro side to attack the opponent*, the most directly relevant candidates are the con-side\u2019s own contentions that serve as the *object of pro-side rebuttal* \u2014 because those are the claims the pro side must reference, challenge, or refute using their evidence.

Thus, these con-side claims function as the *anchor points* for pro-side attacks \u2014 and therefore constitute the relevant \u201cevidence used [by the pro side] to attack\u201d, in the sense of being the focal points of engagement.
